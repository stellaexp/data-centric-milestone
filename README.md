# Working With this Download

This download contains the following directories and files.

* **data** — A directory that contains all of the directories, subdirectories, and files that have changed across the Cloud9 workspace since the workspace was initially created. (This set of changes is also known as a *Docker diff layer*.) This directory corresponds to the workspace's “**/**” directory (also known as the workspace's “root” or “top-level” directory). This directory also contains any database files that were created by databases in the workspace, such as MySQL or MongoDB. The data presented in your Cloud9 IDE's file tree is located in **data/home/ubuntu/workspace**.
* **manifest.json** — A file that contains general information about the Cloud9 workspace, such as the workspace's name, description, and type, as well as information about the Docker base image that Cloud9 used to create the workspace.
* **README.md** — This file.
